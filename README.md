# QuizFrench - Personal App
This project involves making network calls to access data on French words, phrases, and questions stored in a Firebase database. The retrieved JSON data is handled and parsed to organize quiz categories and difficulty levels. Data is displayed within the appâ€™s UI in a clear and cohesive format, providing users with a visually engaging and seamless learning experience.

The UI is built 100% programmatically without the use of Storyboards. The reason for this is to build a deeper understanding and appreciation for UI/UX design implementation.
